        Milla, ever since we talked for the first time, I knew there was a connection between us.
        You are the light of my life, whenever I talk to you it is as if my problems don't exist and there's a warm fuzzy feeling.
        I was drowning in an abyss full of darkness but you saved me, you have literally saved my life and I will forever be grateful for that no matter what.
        I love you so so much, you are the best thing to ever happen to me. Please be by my side no matter what.
        I Love You <3333
